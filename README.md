# TShockPlugin-AntiAccessoryGlitch

## Overview

TShockPlugin-AntiAccessoryGlitch is a plugin designed to address a newly discovered glitch in Terraria. This glitch allows players to equip multiple accessories of the same type, leading to unintended gameplay advantages. The plugin currently resolves this by freezing and kicking players attempting to exploit the glitch, with plans to update it to remove the accessories instead.

## Features

-  Detects and prevents players from equipping multiple accessories of the same type.
-  Freezes and kicks players exploiting the glitch (future update: remove the duplicated accessories).
